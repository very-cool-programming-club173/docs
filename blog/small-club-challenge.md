you want to join the club but not sure if you'll like it,
well then do this one super duper easy challenge (i promise)!

{/* truncate */}

So this challenge is going to be more of a research one, your goal
is to answer the question:
"what does the command "man" print at 00:30 before commit 84bde8"
this is the key to solve this challenge
now this does sound fancy and complex, but just focus on what you understand.

(for example, you can discard the commit part)

theres also a nice tutorial on how to search on the internet
with this blog post:

so that can help
